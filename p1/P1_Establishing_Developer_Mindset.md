## P1.1 Letter to Self

Dear Future Sarah

This letter is for when you are completely stuck and have no idea what's wrong.

First off take a deep breath and relax. What you are feeling is normal, we knew it would happen! Remember the post on Code Conquest (Akiko, 2015) about developing a [**growth mindset**](http://www.codeconquest.com/blog/how-to-navigate-the-up-and-downs-of-learning-to-code/)? It was all about changing your mindset to allow for more productive learning. This is something we're going to have to keep working on.

**Here's a reminder of some tactics to help with it:**

1. Turn negative thoughts into questions
2. Don’t dwell on successes and setbacks. Focus on what you learned and will learn in the future.
3. Don’t compare yourself to more experienced people. Instead, become more aware of how hard they worked to get there.

Have a read of [**this blog**](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard) on Viking Code School (Trautman, 2015) again about the *4 phases of a the typical journey into coding*. Can you identify which stage you're at?

*The Whole Shebang (Trautman, 2015)*

**Here's how to get through it:**

1. Keep [**your goals**](#goals) in mind
2. Find a strong path
3. Focus and avoid distractions

No matter what the challenge is, there is a path that will take you through it. The more you build, the more you will learn. Be patient with yourself. Research the problem you're having, someone else has probably been stuck on the same thing. If you can't find any help on [Stack Overflow] (http://stackoverflow.com) or [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), ask a question and describe your problem as best you can.

Remember how amazing it feels when you get something to work? That feeling is waiting for you. You're logical and your debugging skills are improving all the time. Sometimes all you need is a break, go for a walk, sleep on it and come back with fresh eyes.

This made me laugh so I put it in my letter. Like Dori says, *"just keep swimming!"*

## P1.2 Reflections
 
>**Anything worth achieving is outside of your comfort zone.**

I came across this on social media recently and it made me stop and think. I studied programming in college and did some projects that were challenging for me, not just academically but also personally. They pushed me to operate outside of my comfort zone and gave me a better sense of what I am capable of.

As a developer, I want to have the skills to be great at my job. I want to continue to learn and grow, both personally and professionally. I've always been curious about how things work and I have many interests that I would like to explore.

### My Goals <a name="goals"></a>

I developed an interest in the web shortly after starting college. I created a GitHub repository to experiment with new technologies and frameworks like html5, three.js and bootstrap, but always got sidetracked with something else before I got very far with anything. 

- **My main goal for now is to complete this nanodegree and progress to being a job-ready Front-End Developer!**

- I want to design, create, make, build.
- I want to travel and work remotely for a while. 
- I have a Raspberry Pi, Leap Motion, Kinect, Arduino. I'm interested in creative coding, interaction design, projection mapping, interactive art installations, 3d modelling and rendering. I would like to do a project that includes some or all of this. 
- I want to restore an old house and create a home for my family.
- I want to work for a company that inspires and excites me.
